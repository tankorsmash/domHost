#### A Dominions 6 Net Interface

A simple web interface for Dominions 6. It's a work in progress! It is not affiliated with Illwinter Game Design in any way.

It will eventually allow you to search a lobby, and it will play a sound when your turn is ready. No need to keep the game open in the background, or wait for a Discord notification!

### Note

Not yet working! It doesn't fetch from the server, and only parses a local html file.
